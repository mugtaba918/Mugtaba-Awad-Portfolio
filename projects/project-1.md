# Clinical Data Remediation & Visualization

## Overview
Improved the quality and usability of diabetes-related clinical records by resolving missingness, standardizing values, and converting coded identifiers into stakeholder-friendly labels for reporting.

## Problem
Clinical fields contained high missing values and coded IDs that reduced trust in dashboards and made analysis difficult for non-technical audiences.

## Approach
- Standardized missing values and validated data types  
- Mapped coded identifiers to meaningful descriptions (ID → label)  
- Validated improvements through before/after comparisons  
- Summarized results in stakeholder-ready visuals

## Tools
Python • SQL • Power BI • Data Quality Checks • EDA

## Results & Impact
- Higher clarity and interpretability of key fields  
- Reduced reporting confusion caused by codes/placeholders  
- Improved stakeholder confidence in analytics outputs
