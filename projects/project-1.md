# Clinical Data Remediation & Visualization

## Overview
Clinical datasets often contain missing values, placeholder symbols, and coded identifiers that reduce trust in reporting. This project focused on improving the quality and usability of diabetes-related clinical records to support stakeholder decision-making.

<hr>

## Problem
- High missingness in key clinical markers (e.g., A1C)
- Administrative placeholders mixed with true values
- Coded IDs that are not meaningful without mapping
- Inconsistent or confusing distributions across fields

<hr>

## Approach
- Standardized missing values and verified data types
- Mapped coded identifiers to human-readable descriptions
- Validated results using before/after comparisons and distribution checks
- Summarized improvements in stakeholder-friendly visuals

<hr>

## Tools
Python • SQL • Power BI • EDA • Data Quality Checks

## Results & Impact
- Improved interpretability of key fields
- Reduced confusion caused by coded values
- Increased stakeholder confidence in reports and dashboards
